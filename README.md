# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This was a challenging workshop, but i feel like typing each step out is starting to make sense.
I dont understand the data username bit. I played around some, but took a break to play with css and doing the competency check.
This week's material isn't crystal clear to me, but I am hoping with more practice it will click more.
